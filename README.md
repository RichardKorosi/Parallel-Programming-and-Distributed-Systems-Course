# Korosi-111313-PPDS2024-Assignment-01
This is the first assignment for PPDS-2024.
## Description
Goal of this assignment was to create simple script
with two threads. 

## Examples of application output
This section contains examples of application output.

### First example

<span style="color:cyan">Jano is sleeping.</span>\
<span style="color:cyan">Fero is sleeping.</span>\
<span style="color:cyan">Jano is awake.</span>\
<span style="color:cornflowerblue">Jano is taking a shower.</span>\
<span style="color:cyan">Fero is awake.</span>\
<span style="color:cornflowerblue">Fero is taking a shower.</span>\
<span style="color:cornflowerblue">Fero is clean.</span>\
<span style="color:cornflowerblue">Jano is clean.</span>\
<span style="color:mediumpurple">Jano is eating.</span>\
<span style="color:mediumpurple">Jano has eaten.</span>\
<span style="color:red"> Jano has called.</span>\
<span style="color:red"> Fero has received a call.</span>\
<span style="color:mediumpurple">Fero is eating</span>\
<span style="color:mediumpurple">Fero has eaten</span>

In this example above we can see that Fero finished his hygiene sooner
but he didnt have breakfast until he received a call from Jano.
